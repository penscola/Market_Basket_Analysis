# Market Basket Analysis with Apriori Algorithm 🛒📊

Welcome to my Market Basket Analysis project! In this repository, I explore the fascinating realm of customer purchase patterns using the Apriori algorithm. 🚀

## Project Overview 🌐

Understanding what items customers tend to buy together is crucial for businesses. Market Basket Analysis helps uncover these associations, allowing for strategic decision-making, personalized marketing, and enhanced customer experience.

## Prerequisites 🛠️

Before diving into the project, ensure you have the following:

- Python installed
- Required libraries: NumPy, Pandas, MLxtend (install via `pip install numpy pandas mlxtend`)

## Dataset 📊

The dataset used for this analysis is from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dragonheir/basket-optimisation). Which serves as the foundation for our Apriori algorithm.

## Getting Started 🚀

Follow these steps to replicate the analysis:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/penscola/Market_Basket_Analysis.git`
2. Navigate to the project folder: `cd market-basket-analysis`
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook market_basket_analysis.ipynb`

## Results 📈

Explore the Jupyter Notebook to find detailed insights and visualizations derived from the Apriori algorithm. Uncover association rules, support, confidence, and lift metrics that drive meaningful business decisions.

## Acknowledgments 🙌

A big thank you to the open-source community, especially the creators of MLxtend, for providing a powerful library that simplifies Market Basket Analysis.
